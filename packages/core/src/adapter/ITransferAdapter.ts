/**
 * @module adapter/ITransferAdapter
 *
 * The pluggable storage backend contract.
 *
 * The UploadEngine drives the transfer lifecycle and calls into the adapter
 * at specific points.  Adapters must implement all methods on this interface
 * to be usable with the engine.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 *
 * 1. MINIMAL SURFACE AREA:
 *    The interface contains only what the engine actually needs.
 *    Adapter-specific concepts (e.g. B2's large-file API, S3's MPU) are
 *    hidden inside the adapter implementation.
 *
 * 2. SESSION-ORIENTED:
 *    Each adapter instance is stateless with respect to sessions.
 *    The engine creates a new "remote session" via `initTransfer` and
 *    passes its id back on every subsequent call.  This lets the adapter
 *    stay simple (no Map<sessionId, …> inside it).
 *
 * 3. TYPED ERRORS:
 *    Adapters MUST throw TransferError — not raw HTTP errors.
 *    Mapping HTTP status codes → ErrorCategory is the adapter's job.
 *    The engine never sees raw HTTP errors; it only acts on ErrorCategory.
 *
 * 4. IDEMPOTENT CHUNK UPLOADS:
 *    `uploadChunk` may be called multiple times for the same chunk (retries).
 *    Adapters should be idempotent or detect/overwrite duplicates naturally
 *    (e.g. B2 upload-part is idempotent given the same partNumber).
 *
 * 5. CHECKSUM CONTRACT:
 *    `uploadChunk` receives the pre-computed SHA-256 hex of the chunk data.
 *    Adapters should pass this to the provider for server-side verification
 *    (B2 requires it; S3 supports content-MD5/SHA256).
